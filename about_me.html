                    <p>hello! my name is Audrey and I'm a third year Computer Science and Commerce student at UNSW. I hope you were able to find the 8 countries I've travelled to on the homepage! If not, try to hover your mouse over some continents for a bit longer... 
                        <br><br>
                        I enjoy editing videos, hanging out with my friends and yapping. I prefer the main library over the law library. I love eating yallah. My friends and I usually are in the Hilmer building and I have a cool youtube channel about my daily life!

                    <p>I was also in EngSoc Socials in 2023 and became a director in 2024. I was also in CSESoc Events and WIESoc Public Relations in 2023!
                        I'm not sure if I want to join another society this year... but hopefully I can join the DevSoc training program to learn more about coding *yipee!*
