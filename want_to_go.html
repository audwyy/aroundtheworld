                            I've seen so many pictures of people in the Swiss Alps, and the winter scenery in the mountains looks so nice! I've never been to a European country, and I've heard a lot of
                            great things about the scenery in Switzerland *but* it is the MOST EXPENSIVE country in the world.
                            <br><br>
                            I haven't heard much about the food in Switzerland... but that'll be exciting to try out.
                            <br><br>
                            The little huts and architecture look so cool as well.

                        <p>
                            I've heard that Bali is not too expensive and is affordable (especially the hotels)! The sunset pictures don't compare to the golden hour in Sydney, and the clear water *omg*.
                            <br><br>
                            I've never been to Indonesia, even though my dad is Indonesian... So, I think this is a must-visit destination as I've heard so many good reviews and experiences in Bali!

                        <p>I've heard China is extremely advanced in all aspects from transport to shopping mall. I really want to see the shopping malls and eat more traditional foods because Australia doesn't really have a lot of good Chinese restaurants.
                            The transportation is also really good (unlike Sydney trains...) and everything is very high-tech over there.
                            <br><br>
                            Chinese fashion is also pretty cool. I went to Korea and Japan before and Asian fashion in general is a lot more advanced then Sydney.

                    <div class="left-align">
                        <h1>5. paris</h1>
                        <p>I've head that Paris is not what people expect. But I really want to see the buildings and architecture because it looks so detailed and intricate from the images I've seen online.
                            I want to see the Eiffel Tower at night and try french food. I want to try snails.
                            <br><br>
                            I would defintely go during Spring because the temperature is pretty low when it's Winter. But seeing snow in Paris would be pretty awesome.
